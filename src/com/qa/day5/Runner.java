	// - Abstraction -> hiding implementation (can have abstract and non-abstract methods); Interfaces (only has ABSTRACT METHODS)
	// - Polymorphism -> (many-forms); methods that have multiple forms
	// -- -- method overriding:
	// -- -- method overloading: methods have the same name but with different parameters
	// classes -> create an instance (creating an object of the class)
